= q-cli

Sample Quarkus CLI application.

Shows how a link:https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] application may be configured and packaged to create native
executables with GraalVM Native Image, as well as creating binary distributions (packaged as `.zip` and `.tar.gz`),
finally publishing said binaries as assets on a Git release via link:https://jreleaser.org[JReleaser].

`$ ./mvnw -Pnative package`

== Packaging

`$ ./mvnw -Pdist package`

== Releasing
